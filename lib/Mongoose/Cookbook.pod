Here we go.

=head2 Connecting to MongoDB

Then connect to a database anywhere before starting to use your classes. 

    use Mongoose;
    Mongoose->db( 'mydb'); # looks for a localhost connection

    # or, for more control:

    Mongoose->db(
        host=>'mongodb://data.server:4000',
        db_name=>'mydb'
    );           

This is done globally here for simplicity sake, 
but a more object oriented notation is also supported.

=head2 Connecting to more than one database

This is a work in progress. Right now this syntax is supported:

    Mongoose->db( class=>'Person', db_name=>'mydbone', ... );
    Mongoose->db( class=>'Address', db_name=>'mydbtwo', ... );

But this will most certainly change.

=head2 Loading a Schema

To quickly load your classes, use the C<load_schema> method:

    package main;
    Mongoose->load_schema( search_path=>'MyApp::Schema', shorten=>1 );

Use it only once in your program. Your modules will be required
and may be used from anywhere else. 

The C<shorten> option will alias C<MyApp::Schema::MyClass> into
C<MyClass> for your convenience.

=head2 Preventing attributes from being stored

In case your class has attributes you don't want to store in the database.

    package Person;
    use Moose;
    with 'Mongoose::Document';

    has 'name' => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'Str', required => 1 );
    has 'age'  => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'Int', default  => 40 );
    has 'salary' => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'Int', traits => ['DoNotSerialize'] );

=head2 One-to-many Relationships

This can be accomplished several ways. 

=head3 ArrayRef

Use the C<ArrayRef> Moose type.

    package Person;
    use Moose;
    with 'Mongoose::Document';

    has 'name' => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'Str', required => 1 );
    has 'accounts'  => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'ArrayRef[Account]' );

Then, define the Account class, either as a document or embedded document, 
depending on how you want it stored.

    package Address;
    use Moose;
    with Mongoose::EmbeddedDocument;

    has 'amount' => ...;

But this has a memory and performance cost, since all related rows
will be loaded in memory during object expansion.

To avoid loading related rows, use a L<Mongoose::Join>
parameterized type. 

=head3 Mongoose::Join

Establishing a Mongoose::Join relationship will load relationships
lazily:

    package Person;
    use Moose; with 'Mongoose::Document';

    has 'name' => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'Str', required => 1 );
    has 'accounts'  => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'Mongoose::Join[Account]' );

Then retrieve data with a cursor:

    my $large_acc = $person->accounts->find({ amount => { '$gt' => 100000 } });
    while( my $account = $large_acc->next ) {
        ...
    }

=head2 Sugar for Defining Relationships

Use L<Mongoose::Class> instead of C<Moose>.

    package Article;
    use Mongoose::Class; with 'Mongoose::Document';
    has 'title' => ( is=>'rw', isa=>'Str', required=>1 );
    has_one 'author' => 'Author'; 
    has_many 'comments' => 'Comment'; 
    belongs_to => 'Account';

=head2 Normalizing a Relationship

Normalization is a relational concept, not natural to the
document-oriented MongoDB, but an useful approach that
should sometimes be taken into consideration. 

Sometimes it may just be more adequate than storing relationships
directly in objects:

    package Authorship;
    has_one 'author' => 'Author';
    has_many 'articles' => 'Article';

    package main;

    # create
    my $authorship = Authorship->new;
    $authorship->author( Author->new );
    $authorship->articles->add( Article->new );
    $authorship->articles->add( Article->new );

    # find
    my $articles = Authorship->find_one({ author=>$author->_id });
    while( my $article = $articles->next ) {
        ...
    }

=head2 Package aliasing

To make a long package name shorter, use:

    package My::Mumbo::Jumbo::Class;
    with 'Mongoose::Document' => {
        -as    => 'Mumbo',
    };

    # then in your code

    my $obj = Mumbo->find_one({ flavor=>'gum' })

    print ref $obj;
    # prints 'My::Mumbo::Jumbo::Class'

    print $obj->isa('Mumbo')
    # prints 1

=head2 Method aliasing

In case you don't want a C<find_one> or C<save> method
polluting your class.

    package BankAccount;
    with 'Mongoose::Document' => {
        -alias    => { 'find_one' => '_find_one' },
        -excludes => { 'find_one' },
    };
